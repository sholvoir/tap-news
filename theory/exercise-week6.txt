Q4: Given the three passages:
		Passage #1: I like apples.
        Passage #2: Eating an apple a day keeps the doctor away.
        Passage #3: She is the apple of the eye.
    Please calculate the TF-IDF of the following:
        'apple' in passage #1
        'doctor' in passage #2
        'the' in passage #3
    Please ignore case, plurals and punctuations - you can assume stemming is applied.
    Use base 10 for log.
A4: 'apple': TF = 1/3    IDF = log(3/3) = 0       TF-IDF = TF * IDF = 0
    'doctor': TF = 1/9   IDF = log(3/1) = 0.477   TF-IDF = TF * IDF = 0.053
    'the': TF = 2/7      IDF = log(3/2) = 0.176   TF-IDF = TF * IDF = 0.050
