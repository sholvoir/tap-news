Q1: What is overfitting in machine learning?
A1: Too more training can let model overfit for the training data but not fit for test/real data.

Q2: How to get a good result?
    A. Use simple model if possible.
    B. Use generic (more parameters) model if possible.
    C. Use less training data.
    D. Use more training data.
    E. Use less training steps.
    F. Use more training steps.
    G. Use larger learning rate.
    H. Use smaller learning rate.
    I. Use simple loss function.
    J. Use sophisticated loss function.
    K. Split data into two groups - use one for training, the other one for testing.
A2: AFHIK

Q3: What is one-hot encoding? Why do we use one-hot encoding in machine learning?
A3: One hot encoding is a process by which categorical variables are converted into a form that could 
    be provided to ML algorithms to do a better job in prediction.
    Remove the relationship of number (such as we use 1 to encode 'cat')

Q4: Why are neural networks non-linear?
A4: The purpose of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the network.
    Non-linear means that the output cannot be reproduced from a linear combination of the inputs.

Q5: Why it is difficult to train neural networks? 
    A. Supervised learning
    B. Unsupervised learning
    C. Reinforcement learning
A5: C

Q6: Whatâ€™s the execution result of the following Tensorflow code and why?
A6: Tensor("MatMul:0", shape=(1, 1), dtype=float32)
    Because product is a function and have not execute.
